# NN_API 

A basic example of web application serving a torchvision model.

The service receives a response with a file with a `file` name and returns the output of one of the [torchvision object detection models](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models.html#object-detection-instance-segmentation-and-person-keypoint-detection).
